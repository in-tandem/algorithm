'''
We are going to create a grid square .

We will ask our a* algorithm to find the shortest distance
between top most left node to bottom most right node

Once found, we will also perform some optimization techniques
such as changing the neighbor values and changing the distance
metric

Assumptions:
<i> We know the start node, and the end node</i>
<i> We do not know the neighbors of a particular node.</i>
